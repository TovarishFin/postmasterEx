Save money before you ship, while you ship, and after you ship.\n\nhttps://www.postmaster.io/\n\n\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n```\nnpm install postmaster-shipping\n```\n\n<h2>Usage</h2>\nIf the library was installed through ```npm```:\n\n```\nvar postmaster = require('postmaster-shipping')({\n    apiKey: '0b9a54438fba2dc0d39be8f7c6c71a58',\n    password: undefined\n}, true);\n```\n\nIf running from source, see ```test/index.js``` for sample code.\n\nFor those who have passwordless accounts, simply leave the password field as ```undefined```. The ```true``` flag indicates debug mode, which outputs slightly more information to the console.\n\nSee https://www.postmaster.io/docs for further tutorials and documentation.\n\n<h2>Issues</h2>\nPlease use appropriately tagged github <a href=\"https://github.com/postmaster/postmaster-api/issues\">issues</a> to request features or report bugs.\n",
